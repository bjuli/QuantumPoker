    " ## Intro\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this quantum version of poker, the players are initially dealt a __hand__ which consists of things called quantum gates. That is, everyone gets three quantum gates and no one knows exactly which gates the other players got. Furthermore, each player has their own personal set of five qubits that serve as the \"__community cards__\" on the table. These qubits will be _measured_ at the end of the game, and you either _measure_ a $1$ or a $0$. Admittedly, this sounds just like a normal bit. A bit can _be_ either $1$, corresponding to ``ON`` (letting current through a transistor), or $0$, corresponding to ``OFF`` (not letting current through). Note the language usage here: the difference between _measuring_ $1$ and _being_ $1$ will become important. The qubits will look the same for all the players at first, but you will get a chance to manipulate your personal qubits before they are measured.\n",
    "  #### _Goal_\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The __goal__ is to measure as many $1$â€™s as possible at the end of the game. In order to do that, you have to apply the quantum gates from your hand to change the measurement outcomes. This happens right after the rounds of betting are finished. Incidentally, betting is done as in normal Texas hold 'em poker.\n",
    "  #### _Quantum weirdness_\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why is _measurement_ so important? This is where the \"quantum\" in Quantum Poker comes in. You might have heard the following paraphrased statement: \n",
    "> The weird thing about the quantum world is that if you aren't looking, anything goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: yes, when you _measure_ (\"look at\") your qubits you get either a $0$ or a $1$, but _before_ you measure them, they can - in a way - _be_ __both $0$ and $1$ at the same time__. We say that the qubit _is_ in a state of __superposition__, and if you _measure_ it you find either $1$ or $0$. In this case you can't tell whether you will measure a $0$ or a $1$, and oftentimes all you know is that if you measure a qubit, you will get $1$ with some probability and $0$ with some probability. Fortunately, you as a player can affect your personal qubits using the quantum gates in your hand. Therefore, any player who has not folded by the end of a game should apply their gates in such a way that each qubit has a high probability of yielding $1$ when measured. We will get back to the specifics of this later."
